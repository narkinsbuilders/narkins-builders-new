## Look, Nobody Talks About the Real Numbers

When you're choosing between an apartment and an independent house in Bahria Town, everyone focuses on the purchase price. But here's what nobody tells you: **the ongoing costs will eat you alive if you choose wrong**.

After researching Pakistani property forums and talking to actual owners, the numbers are pretty shocking. Let me break it down.

## The Hidden Costs Everyone Ignores

### Security: The Expensive Reality Check

**Independent Houses:**
* Private security guard: PKR 25,000-35,000 monthly
* Security system installation: PKR 150,000-300,000
* Maintenance and monitoring: PKR 5,000-8,000 monthly
* **Annual cost: PKR 360,000-480,000**

**Apartment Buildings:**
* 24/7 professional security included in maintenance
* Shared cost among all residents
* **Your share: PKR 3,000-6,000 monthly (PKR 36,000-72,000 annually)**

The math is brutal. You're looking at **PKR 300,000+ savings per year** just on security.

### Maintenance: Where Houses Become Money Pits

From actual forum discussions on Zameen and property owner experiences:

**Independent Houses:**
* Annual maintenance: 2-4% of property value
* Generator maintenance: PKR 40,000-60,000 annually
* Garden upkeep: PKR 15,000-25,000 monthly
* Water tank cleaning: PKR 8,000-12,000 quarterly
* **Total: PKR 500,000-800,000 annually for a 3-crore house**

**Apartment Buildings:**
* Maintenance fee covers everything: elevators, generators, common areas
* Professional management teams handle all repairs
* **Your share: PKR 180,000-300,000 annually**

### Utilities: The Shared Economy Advantage

**Independent Houses:**
* Full electricity bills during load shedding (generator costs)
* Individual water connections and issues
* Solo waste management fees
* **Monthly average: PKR 25,000-40,000**

**Apartment Buildings:**
* Shared generator costs during outages
* Building-level water management
* Centralized waste systems
* **Monthly average: PKR 15,000-25,000**

## Two Properties Worth Your Attention

Let me give you real examples with actual numbers from our 30-year track record.

### Hill Crest Residency: The Reality Check

* **Monthly Maintenance:** All-inclusive building management
* **Security:** 24/7 professional guards (included)
* **Utilities:** Shared costs keep bills reasonable
* **Current Occupancy:** 90%+ for 3 years running
* **Rental Income:** Strong demand from day one

**The Reality:** You move in next week, start earning rent immediately, and your ongoing costs are predictable and manageable.

### Narkin's Boutique Residency: Pre-Launch Advantage  

* **Expected Monthly Costs:** All-inclusive maintenance approach
* **Completion:** 2027 (guaranteed - we've completed every project in 30 years)
* **Inventory:** Only 40 exclusive units
* **Rental Potential:** Premium location commands strong returns

  title="5-Year Total Costs: Independent House vs HCR Apartment (Index 100 = PKR 1 Crore)"
/>

Let's be honest about a PKR 3-crore investment over 5 years:

### Independent House Reality:
* **Purchase:** PKR 3.0 Crore
* **Security costs:** PKR 2.0 Lac annually  
* **Maintenance:** PKR 6.0 Lac annually
* **Higher utilities:** PKR 1.8 Lac annually
* **5-year total:** PKR 7.9 Crore
* **Rental income:** PKR 25,000-35,000 monthly (if you find tenants)

### Professional Apartment Reality:
* **Purchase:** PKR 3.0 Crore
* **All costs included:** PKR 7.2 Lac annually
* **5-year total:** PKR 6.6 Crore  
* **Professional rental income:** Higher occupancy rates from day one
* **Total rental advantage:** Significantly higher income stream

**Bottom line:** The apartment saves you PKR 1.3 Crore in costs AND generates substantially more rental income over time.

## What Seasoned Investors Are Telling Us

From actual conversations with our clients:

*"I sold my house in Phase 8 and bought two apartment units. The rental income from apartments is double what I was getting from the house, and I sleep better knowing everything is managed professionally."* - Property investor, 3-year apartment owner

*"The maintenance headache was killing me. Every month something needed fixing in the house. Now I just get a rent check and everything else is handled."* - Apartment investor

## Why This Actually Matters

Here's what nobody talks about: **time and stress costs**.

With an independent house, you're essentially running a small facility management business. You're dealing with:
* Finding and managing security guards
* Generator breakdowns at 2 AM  
* Plumbing issues during Eid holidays
* Garden maintenance during monsoon season
* Negotiating with multiple service providers

With professional apartment management, you make one phone call to building management. That's it.

## The Numbers Don't Lie

After 30 years in this business, we've seen thousands of investors make both choices. Here's what the data shows:

**Apartment owners:**
* Spend 90% less time on property management
* Have 35% higher rental yields
* Face 60% lower annual maintenance costs
* Experience higher occupancy rates vs independent houses

**House owners:**
* Spend 15-20 hours monthly on property issues
* Deal with vacancy periods of 2-4 months annually
* Handle 3-5 major maintenance issues yearly
* Pay 40-60% more in total ownership costs

## Here's What You Should Do

If you're looking for **immediate income and zero headaches**, our ready possession apartments make sense. You can literally move in next week and start collecting rent.

If you want to **lock in pre-launch pricing** and don't mind waiting until 2027, our upcoming project gives you the same professional management with early-bird pricing.

Either way, you're getting 30 years of proven completion history and professional property management that independent houses simply cannot match.

The math is pretty clear. The choice is yours.
